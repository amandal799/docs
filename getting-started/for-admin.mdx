## Welcome, Admin!

As an **Admin**, you have full control over your institute on Acadine. You'll set up the foundation—centers, courses, batches, and users—and manage day-to-day operations like scheduling lectures, tracking analytics, and making announcements.

<Info>
**All admins have the same access level**

Whether you're the first admin or the tenth, everyone has equal control over the platform. This makes it easy to distribute responsibilities across your team.
</Info>

## Your Admin Dashboard

When you log in, you'll see:

- **Institute-wide analytics** - Performance across all students, batches, and centers
- **Quick actions** - Create batches, onboard users, schedule lectures, make announcements
- **Recent activity** - Latest tests, uploads, and notifications
- **User management** - Access to all students, teachers, and admins

## Initial Setup: Get Your Institute Ready

Follow these steps in order to set up your institute on Acadine for the first time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Centers/Branches">
    Create your physical locations (e.g., Delhi Center, Mumbai Branch).

    **Why first?** Because batches need to be associated with a specific center.

    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Courses/Targets">
    Define the academic programs your institute offers (e.g., JEE 2025, NEET 2024, Class 11 CBSE).

    **Good news:** Each course comes with subjects pre-configured with exam board-aligned syllabus. You don't need to configure anything manually.

    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Onboard Teachers">
    Add teachers who will be assigned to batches and manage teaching activities.

    Teachers can generate question papers, schedule tests, upload study materials, and track student performance.

    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Batches & Assign Teachers">
    Create batches by combining a center and a course (e.g., "JEE 2025 Morning Batch" at Delhi Center).

    Assign teachers to each batch so they can manage students and content.

    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Onboard Students">
    Add students to your institute and assign them to batches.

    **Three methods based on your needs:**

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Invite Link">
        **Use when:** You don't have complete student details in advance (e.g., during admissions).

        Generate an invite link for a specific batch. Share it with students—they'll sign up and submit their details. **You'll need to approve each student before they can access their dashboard.**

          Learn how to generate invite links
        </Card>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Excel Upload">
        **Use when:** You have all student details ready in a spreadsheet.

        Upload an Excel file with student information, and they'll all be onboarded at once with immediate access.

        <Card title="Bulk Upload via Excel" icon="file-excel" href="/students/onboard-students-excel">

        </Card>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Single Student">
        **Use when:** Adding one student at a time with complete details.

        Fill out a form with student information, and they'll be onboarded immediately with full access.

        <Card title="Onboard Single Student" icon="user-plus" href="/students/onboard-single-student">
          Learn how to add students individually
        </Card>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add More Admins (Optional)">
    If you need additional admins to help manage the institute, onboard them here.

    All admins have equal access and can perform any administrative task.

    </Card>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Start small, then scale**

If you're setting up Acadine for the first time, start with one center and one course. Once you're comfortable, add more centers, courses, and batches.
</Tip>
