Understanding these core concepts will help you navigate Acadine and make the most of its features.

## Institute Structure

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Center / Branch" icon="building">
    A **Center** (also called **Branch**) is a physical location of your institute. We use both terms interchangeably since different institutes prefer different terminology.

    **Examples:**
    - Delhi Center
    - Mumbai Branch
    - Bangalore HSR Layout Center

    You can manage multiple centers from a single Acadine dashboard, making it easy to scale across locations.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Course / Target" icon="bullseye">
    A **Course** (also called **Target**) is an academic program your institute offers. We use both terms because different institutes refer to them differently.

    **Examples:**
    - JEE 2025
    - NEET 2024
    - Class 11 Commerce CBSE
    - Class 10 ICSE
    - CA Foundation
    - UPSC Prelims 2025

    Each course is aligned to specific exam boards and contains subjects, syllabus, and target examinations.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch" icon="users">
    A **Batch** is a group of students enrolled in a specific course at a specific center. Think of it as a classroom or section.

    **Examples:**
    - JEE 2025 Morning Batch (Delhi Center)
    - NEET 2024 Weekend Batch (Mumbai Branch)
    - Class 11 Commerce Section A (Bangalore Center)

    Batches help you organize students, assign teachers, schedule lectures, and track performance for specific groups.

## Curriculum & Content

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Syllabus" icon="book">
    The **Syllabus** is the curriculum content aligned to specific exam boards (CBSE, ICSE, State Boards, UPSC, etc.). It defines what topics students need to learn.

    Acadine's AI uses syllabus mapping to:
    - Generate relevant question papers
    - Ensure coverage of all topics
    - Track performance at chapter/topic/subtopic levels

    [Learn how to configure syllabus →](/courses-targets/edit-syllabus)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exam Boards" icon="certificate">
    **Exam Boards** are educational standards bodies that define curriculum and conduct examinations.

    **Examples:**
    - CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education)
    - ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education)
    - State Boards (Maharashtra, Karnataka, etc.)
    - UPSC (Union Public Service Commission)
    - Competitive exams (JEE, NEET)

    Acadine's AI evaluation is aligned to these exam board standards for consistent grading.
  </Accordion>

    Each subject contains:
    - Chapters

    - Chapter
    - Topic

    Students can access materials anytime through their dashboard or mobile app.
