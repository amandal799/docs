## Core Teacher Workflows

### A. Content Delivery

Your first step is to provide students with learning materials and practice opportunities.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Study Materials">
    Share educational resources with your students—PDFs, videos, notes, presentations, or any learning material.

    **Organize by:**
    - Subject
    - Chapter
    - Topic

    Students can access materials anytime through their dashboard or mobile app.

    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Assignments">
    Provide practice work or homework for students to reinforce learning.

    **Key Points:**
    - Assignments are for practice/homework (not formal tests)
    - Students upload answer sheets on their own
    - NOT auto-evaluated by default (you can manually grade if needed)

    </Card>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Assignment vs Test**

- **Assignment:** Practice/homework → Students upload on their own → NOT auto-evaluated
- **Test:** Formal assessment → Admin uploads answer sheets → Auto-evaluated by AI in 24 hours
</Note>

### B. Assessment Cycle

Creating and scheduling tests is where Acadine's AI saves you massive amounts of time.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Question Paper with AI">
    Create a complete question paper in **10 minutes** instead of 10 hours.

    **Configure:**
    - Syllabus weightage (which chapters to cover)
    - Question types (MCQ, short answer, long answer, numerical)
    - Marks distribution
    - Difficulty levels

    AI generates a complete paper aligned to exam board standards (CBSE, ICSE, UPSC, etc.).
