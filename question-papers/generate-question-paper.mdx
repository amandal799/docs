## Generation Modes

Acadine offers two ways to create question papers:

- **Auto Generate:** AI creates a complete, balanced question paper automatically based on your configuration. Perfect for quick test creation.
- **Build with AI:** Create your paper step-by-step with full control while AI provides intelligent suggestions. Ideal when you want to handpick each question.

Both modes allow full editing capabilities after generation.
