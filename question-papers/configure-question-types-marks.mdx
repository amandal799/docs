## Overview

Configure the types of questions, their subtypes, and marks distribution for your question paper. This determines the structure and scoring of your assessment.

<Note>
**Auto-Import**: If you imported syllabus configuration from a previous question paper, the question types and marks configuration from that paper is automatically imported as well. You can override it by manually configuring your own or importing from another question paper.
</Note>

## Two Ways to Configure

You can configure question types and marks in two ways:

1. **Manual Configuration** - Select question subtypes and specify question count and marks
2. **Import from Previous Question Paper** - Reuse configuration from a past question paper and edit if needed

---

## Method 1: Manual Configuration

### Step 1: Browse Question Types and Subtypes

You'll see all supported question types organized into categories:

- **Multiple Choice** - Direct Conceptual, Statement Analysis/Assertion Reason, Scenario Based, Matching/Sequencing
- **Short Answer** - Direct Conceptual, Compare/Differentiate, Scenario Based, Numerical
- **Long Answer** - Direct Conceptual, Compare/Differentiate, Scenario Based, Numerical
- **Very Long Answer** - Direct Conceptual, Compare/Differentiate, Scenario Based, Numerical

Each question type shows the available subtypes beneath it.

<Note>
**Course & Subject Specific**: The available question types and subtypes may vary across different courses and subjects. We keep this comprehensive and updated with current exam patterns.
</Note>

Use the following options to manage your view:
- **Collapse All**: Collapse all question types to see only main categories
- **Clear All**: Remove all configured question types and marks

### Step 2: Select Question Subtypes

Click on a subtype checkbox to include it in your question paper. When you select a subtype, a configuration form appears immediately.

### Step 3: Configure Question Count and Marks

For each selected subtype, you need to specify:

1. **Question Count**: Total number of questions of this subtype
2. **Marks/Question**: Marks allocated per question

<Note>
**Equal Marks**: All questions of the same type and subtype will have equal marks. For example, if you set 3 marks for "Multiple Choice > Direct Conceptual", all Direct Conceptual MCQs will carry 3 marks each.
</Note>

## Track Your Progress

The header at the top shows a real-time summary of your configuration:

- **Total Questions**: How many questions you've configured across all types
- **Total Marks**: Sum of all marks (Questions × Marks per Question)

<Tip>
The summary updates automatically as you add or modify question types, helping you ensure your question paper meets your requirements.

## Method 2: Import from Previous Question Paper

### Step 2: Select Question Paper

Choose a previously created question paper from the list. After selecting, click the **"Import & Continue"** button to import the question type and marks configuration from that paper.

### Step 3: Edit if Needed

Once imported, you can edit the configuration just like in manual mode:
- Add or remove question subtypes
- Adjust question counts
- Change marks per question

<Tip>
**Consistent Assessments**: This method is perfect when you want to maintain consistency in question distribution across multiple assessments.
